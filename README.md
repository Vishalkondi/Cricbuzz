# Live Cricket Scores Application

This is a live cricket scores web application built with **React** that fetches and displays real-time cricket match scores. The app showcases live scores, match status, and other relevant details such as teams playing, current score, and match status.

## Features
- Display live cricket match scores.
- Show team logos for both teams.
- Display match status (e.g., match in progress, match ended).
- Interactive and responsive UI using React.
- Mock data for demonstration (can be replaced with real API integration).

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js, CSS
- **UI Framework**: Bootstrap (for responsiveness)
- **State Management**: React's `useState` and `useEffect`

## Project Structure
/src /assets - Team logos (flag images) used to represent each cricket team (e.g., India, Australia, etc.)

/components - LiveScores.js: React component that handles the fetching and displaying of live cricket scores. This component contains the layout and logic to display match details like teams, scores, and statuses.

/pages - LiveScores.css: Contains the CSS styles for the LiveScores page. These styles manage the layout, color scheme, and responsiveness of the live score cards and match information.

App.js - Main entry point for the application. It renders the LiveScores component and applies global styles.

index.js - The entry point for React to render the app into the DOM. It typically contains ReactDOM.render to display the root component (App.js) into the HTML element with id="root".

package.json - Manages project dependencies (like React, Bootstrap) and scripts (such as npm start).

/public - index.html: The single HTML page for your app, which includes the root div element (<div id="root"></div>) where your React app will be injected.

/node_modules - This folder contains all the installed npm packages and their dependencies for the project (donâ€™t modify this folder manually).
